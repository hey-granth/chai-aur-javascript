# Chai Aur JavaScript ~ Chai aur Code

This is a repository that contains a collection of JavaScript code snippets and examples, made while learning javascript fromm the mentioned [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37&si=5pKmofByjnr70rFE). The purpose of this repository is to provide a quick reference for common JavaScript tasks and to help developers learn and improve their JavaScript skills.

The code snippets are organized into different files based on the topic or concept being covered. Each file contains code examples, explanations, and comments to help understand the code.

> Note: This repository is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to JavaScript, but rather a collection of useful code snippets and examples that can be used as a reference. It is recommended to refer to the official [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for more in-depth information and best practices. This repository is nothing more than a personal guide.
